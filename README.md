# learning Objective
The main purpose of this project is to learn how to
create multiple pages, structure HTML in a semantic way,
future proof the structure, and add SEO meta tags.

# Challenges
The only challenge was the SEO tags. I did not understand
what SEO tags to add for my project. I did a bit of research
and figured out pretty quickly what tags to use.

# Tech Stack
